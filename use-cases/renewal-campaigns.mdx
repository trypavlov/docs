description: "Proactive renewal management that prevents churn before it happens"
---

This guide walks you through configuring a renewal campaign in Trig, with detailed explanations of why each configuration choice matters and how to think through decisions for your specific business.

<Note>
**Worked Example:** Throughout this guide, we'll follow TeamFlow, a collaborative project management tool with 2,000 customers. Their product is sticky when teams actively use it, but customers who don't achieve full team adoption often churn at renewal. With only 4 CSMs, they can't personally manage every renewal.
</Note>

## Why Proactive Renewal Management Matters

### The Renewal Reality

By the time a customer tells you they're not renewing, the decision was made weeks or months ago. The renewal conversation is just the notification—the actual decision happened during:

- The month they stopped logging in
- The week their champion left
- The day they couldn't get a support issue resolved

Proactive renewal management means detecting these moments early enough to intervene.

### The Cost of Reactive Renewal

| Approach | Detection Point | Intervention Success |
|----------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Reactive** | Customer says "we're not renewing" | 10-20% save rate |
| **Proactive (late)** | 30 days before renewal, health check | 30-40% save rate |
| **Proactive (early)** | 60+ days before, warning signs detected | 50-70% save rate |

---

## Step 1: Define Your Renewal Window

### What You're Configuring

The renewal window determines how far in advance of a customer's renewal date they enter your renewal campaign.

### How to Choose Your Window

Consider your typical "save" conversation timeline:

| Window Length | Best For | Considerations |
|---------------|----------|----------------|
| **30 days** | SMB, self-serve, low-touch | Fast cycles, quick decisions |
| **60 days** | Mid-market, moderate touch | Time for 1-2 intervention attempts |
| **90+ days** | Enterprise, high-touch | Complex buying processes, multiple stakeholders |

### Example: TeamFlow's Decision

TeamFlow chose 60 days because their typical "save" conversation requires:

- **Week 1:** Identify the problem (usage drop, champion left, etc.)
- **Week 2:** Diagnostic call with the customer
- **Weeks 3-4:** Implement solution (training, configuration change)
- **Weeks 5-6:** Verify the solution is working
- **Weeks 7-8:** Buffer for delays

```
Renewal Window: 60 days before renewal date
```

---

## Step 2: Set Your Entry Criteria

### Example Configuration

```
Entry Criteria:
- Renewal date is within 60 days
- Customer status = Active
- Contract type = Annual
```

<Tip>
**Start simple.** You can add segment-specific criteria later (e.g., different windows for enterprise vs. SMB).
</Tip>

## Step 3: Configure Renewal Health Assessment

### Healthy Renewal Indicators

These signals indicate a customer is on track to renew without intervention:

| Indicator | What It Means | How to Measure |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Consistent usage | Product is embedded in workflow | DAU/WAU/MAU stable or growing |
| Recent feature adoption | Still investing in learning | New features used in last 30 days |
| Expanding usage | More users or use cases | Seat count increase, new team adoption |
| Support engagement | They ask questions, they care | Support tickets with positive resolution |
| Champion engagement | Internal advocate is active | Champion user login frequency |

### TeamFlow's Healthy Indicators

```
Healthy Renewal Indicators:
- Usage in last 14 days: Yes
- Active users: ≥70% of licensed seats
- Champion last login: Within 7 days
- Open escalated tickets: 0
```

### At-Risk Renewal Indicators

These warning signs signal a customer may not renew:

| Warning Sign | What It Signals | How to Measure |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Usage decline | Decreasing engagement | 30%+ drop vs prior period |
| Champion absence | Advocate has disengaged | No login in 30+ days |
| Low seat utilisation | Not getting full value | <50% of seats active |
| Support frustration | Unresolved issues | Open tickets, negative sentiment |
| Invoice issues | Financial friction | Late payments, billing disputes |

### TeamFlow's At-Risk Indicators

```
At-Risk Renewal Indicators:
- Usage decline: >30% drop in WAU vs 30 days ago
- Champion login: >21 days since last activity
- Seat utilisation: <50% of licensed seats active
- Open support tickets: >2 unresolved for >14 days
```

### Pattern Recognition

TeamFlow identified four churn patterns from their data:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pattern 1: The Slow Fade">
    **Signal:** Usage drops 30%+ over 30 days

    **Cause:** Often happens when a key project ends or team priorities shift

    **Intervention:** Re-engage with new use case discovery
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pattern 2: The Champion Departure">
    **Signal:** Primary buyer/champion stops logging in

    **Cause:** Often means they've left the company or changed roles

    **Intervention:** Identify and engage new stakeholder
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pattern 3: The Underutilised Account">
    **Signal:** Paying for 20 seats, only 8 active users

    **Cause:** Often means the rollout stalled after initial enthusiasm

    **Intervention:** Adoption support, training offer
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pattern 4: The Frustrated Customer">
    **Signal:** Multiple support tickets unresolved for 14+ days

    **Cause:** Often means they've hit a wall and are giving up

    **Intervention:** Escalation, executive attention
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 4: Configure At-Risk Renewal Interventions

### Trigger Configuration

```
Trigger Condition:
- Customer is within 60 days of renewal
- AND matches any At-Risk Indicator
- AND has not received intervention in last 30 days
```

<Note>
**OR vs AND Logic:** TeamFlow chose OR logic—any single warning sign triggers the campaign. "We'd rather have false positives than miss a churning customer."
</Note>

## Step 5: Write Your Intervention Message

### Message Best Practices

| Principle | Why It Works | Common Mistake |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| Plain text format | Feels like a real email | HTML templates scream "marketing automation" |
| Human sender | People respond to people | "The TeamFlow Team" gets ignored |
| Acknowledge reality | Shows you're paying attention | Pretending everything is fine |
| Offer help, not sales | Reduces defensiveness | "Let's talk about your renewal" = instant delete |
| Single ask | Clear next step | Multiple CTAs create paralysis |

### Example Message

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Draft 1 (Rejected)">
    ```
    Subject: Your TeamFlow Renewal is Coming Up

    Dear {first_name},

    We noticed that your annual TeamFlow subscription will be
    renewing on {renewal_date}. We wanted to reach out to ensure
    you have everything you need for a smooth renewal process.

    Our records indicate some changes in your usage patterns
    recently. We'd love to schedule a call to discuss how
    TeamFlow can continue to support your team's project
    management needs.

    Please let us know if you have any questions.

    Best regards,
    The TeamFlow Customer Success Team
    ```

    **Problems:**
    - "Dear" is formal and cold
    - "The TeamFlow Customer Success Team" isn't a person
    - "smooth renewal process" makes it about the transaction
    - "changes in your usage patterns" is vague and ominous
    - No specific ask
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Draft 2 (Approved)">
    ```
    Subject: Quick question about your team's projects

    Hi {first_name},

    I noticed your team's activity in [Product] has dropped off
    over the past few weeks. Before your renewal comes up in
    {days_until_renewal} days, I wanted to check in.

    If something's not working the way you need it to, I'd
    genuinely like to hear about it — there might be features
    or configurations we haven't explored that could help.

    Do you have 15 minutes this week for a quick call?

    Sarah
    Customer Success
    ```

    **Why this works:**
    - "Hi" is warm and normal
    - Sarah is a real person (or believable persona)
    - "dropped off" acknowledges reality without accusation
    - Offers help, not a sales pitch
    - Single clear ask: 15-minute call
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Message Variants by Trigger

| Trigger | Message Focus |
|---------|---------------|
| Usage drop | "I noticed activity has dropped..." |
| Champion absent | "I haven't seen {champion} in [Product] recently..." |
| Low adoption | "I noticed only {X} of your {Y} team members are active..." |
| Support issues | "I saw you've had some support tickets open..." |

---

## Step 6: Configure Sender Identity

### Options

| Sender Type | Best For |
|-------------|----------|
| Real CSM (dynamic) | Accounts with named CSM relationships |
| CS Persona (static) | Accounts without assigned CSMs |
| Functional Role | Transactional communications |

### TeamFlow's Decision

- **High-value accounts (>$25K):** Email from actual assigned CSM
- **All other accounts:** Email from "Sarah Chen" — a shared persona that any team member can respond as

---

## Step 7: Set Message Timing

### Timing Considerations

| Option | Trade-off |
|--------|-----------|
| Immediately | Maximum relevance, unpredictable timing |
| Wait X hours | Less urgency, allows batching |
| Next business day, specific time | Predictable, but less contextual |
| Customer timezone optimised | Best of both, requires timezone data |

### TeamFlow's Decision

```
Message Timing:
- Within 25 minutes of trigger
- Delivery window: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM customer timezone
- If trigger fires outside window, queue for next available slot
```

---

## Step 8: Configure Internal Escalation

### Tiered Escalation System

| Tier | Trigger | Channel | Action Expected |
|------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| **1: Standard** | All at-risk triggers | #renewals-at-risk Slack | CSM reviews, decides on follow-up |
| **2: High-Value** | $25K+ contracts | CSM DM + Manager | Same-day review, potential executive outreach |
| **3: Critical** | Multiple at-risk signals + <30 days | CS Manager + VP Sales | Executive intervention, discount authority |

### Sample Slack Notification

```
🚨 At-Risk Renewal Alert

Customer: Acme Corp
Contract Value: $18,000/year
Renewal Date: March 15 (47 days)

Warning Signs Detected:
• Usage down 42% vs last month
• Primary contact last login: 28 days ago

Automated intervention sent to: john.smith@acme.com
Subject: "Quick question about your team's projects"

```

## Step 9: Configure Follow-Up Logic

### Follow-Up Sequence

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Day 0 | Initial intervention message sent |
| Day 5 | If no response → Send follow-up message |
| Day 10 | If no response → Internal escalation |
| Day 14 | If no response → Phone call attempt (high-value) |

### Follow-Up Message

```
Subject: Re: Quick question about your team's projects

Hi {first_name},

Just floating this back up—I'd love to help if something's
not working the way you need.

Even a quick reply with what's going on would help me point
you in the right direction.

Sarah
```

## Step 10: Define Success Metrics

### Metrics to Track

| Metric | What It Measures |
|--------|------------------|
| **At-risk identification rate** | % of renewals flagged as at-risk |
| **Intervention response rate** | % who reply or engage |
| **Save rate** | % of at-risk customers who renew |
| **False positive rate** | % flagged at-risk who would have renewed anyway |
| **Net retention** | Overall renewal + expansion revenue |

### Benchmarking

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| At-risk identification | 20-30% of renewals |
| Intervention response | 15-25% |
| Save rate (with intervention) | 40-60% |
| Save rate (without intervention) | 10-20% |
