This guide shows you how to use Signals to identify at-risk customers and create targeted interventions.

## Understanding Signals

Signals automatically surface customers who are falling behind. Rather than manually hunting for problems, Signals tell you exactly who needs attention and why.

### What Signals Show You

```
Signal: Slow Completers - "Create First Invoice"
Stage: Onboarding
Customers affected: 23
Revenue at risk: £127,000
Average completion: 4 days
These customers: 8+ days pending
```

Each Signal tells you:
- **Which objective** customers are stuck on
- **How many** are affected
- **Revenue at risk** (from CRM data)
- **How far behind** they are compared to average

## Prerequisites

To generate Signals, you need:

<Check>Lifecycle stages configured and live</Check>
<Check>Objectives defined with completion criteria</Check>
<Check>Customers actively in stages</Check>
<Check>Sufficient completions for meaningful averages (10+)</Check>

## Navigating Signals

### The Signals Dashboard

Navigate to **Signals** in the main navigation to see:

**Summary metrics:**
- Total customers at risk
- Total revenue at risk
- Number of active Signals

**Signal feed:**
- List of current Signals
- Sorted by revenue impact
- Click any Signal to see details

### Drilling Into a Signal

Click on a Signal to see:

1. **Which customers** are affected (list with key attributes)
2. **How long** each has been pending
3. **Revenue** associated with each
4. **Quick action** to create a campaign

## Acting on Signals

### Reviewing the Signal

Before creating a campaign, review:

| Question | What to Look For |
|----------|-----------------|
| Is this worth acting on? | Revenue at risk, customer importance |
| Why are they stuck? | Common attributes, patterns |
| What intervention makes sense? | Email, CSM outreach, different approach |

### Creating a Campaign from a Signal

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the Signal">
    From the Signals dashboard, click into the Signal you want to act on
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review affected customers">
    Check the list to understand who's included
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click 'Create Campaign'">
    This pre-populates the audience with the Signal's customers
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the campaign">
    Set goal, duration, and messaging specific to this issue
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch">
    Go live to start the intervention
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Campaign Strategy for Signals

**Address the specific blocker:**
These customers are stuck on a specific objective. Your message should directly address that issue.

```
Subject: Quick tip to connect your payment gateway

Hi {first_name},

I noticed you've been using FreshBooks to send invoices—great progress!

The next step is connecting your payment gateway so clients can pay
online. Here's how:

1. Go to Settings > Payments
2. Click "Connect Gateway"
3. Follow the prompts for Stripe or PayPal

Takes about 5 minutes and means faster payments.

Reply if you need help!

Thanks,
Lee
```

**Keep it timely:**
They're already behind. Act quickly once you see the Signal.

**Set appropriate duration:**
They've been slow, so give them reasonable time—but don't let it drag on.

## Signal Workflow Example

### Scenario: Onboarding Slow Completers

**Signal appears:**
```
Slow Completers - Complete Profile Setup
12 customers | £34,000 revenue at risk
Average: 3 days | These customers: 8+ days
```

**Step 1: Review**
- Click into the Signal
- See the 12 customers listed
- Notice 8 are self-serve, 4 are enterprise
- Mix of industries and sizes

**Step 2: Decide**
Worth intervening? Yes—profile completion is a key onboarding step, and £34K revenue is significant.

**Step 3: Create Campaign**

```
Campaign: Profile Completion Nudge
Goal: profile_complete = true
Audience: [Pre-populated from Signal]
Duration: 7 days

Entry Action: Email
Subject: Complete your profile in 2 minutes

Hi {first_name},

I noticed you're getting started with [Product] but haven't
completed your profile yet.

Here's why it matters:
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]

Here's how (takes 2 minutes):
1. Click your avatar → Settings
2. Fill in the profile fields
3. Click Save

Reply if you have questions!
```

**Step 4: Launch and Monitor**
- Go live
- Monitor completion rate
- Review results after 7 days

**Step 5: Iterate**
- 8 complete → Success
- 4 exit → Need different approach? Manual CSM outreach?
- New Signal appears next week with fresh slow completers

## Patterns and Best Practices

### Act Quickly on Signals

Signals show customers already behind. Delay compounds the problem.

| Timing | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Same day | Review new Signals |
| Within 24 hours | Create campaign if warranted |
| Within 48 hours | Campaign should be live |

### Don't Over-Intervene

- Customers shouldn't receive too many automated messages
- Some slowness may be acceptable (enterprise often moves slower)
- Use exclusions to prevent campaign overlap

### Review Recurring Signals

If the same Signal keeps appearing:

| Question | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| Is the objective realistic? | Maybe the expected timing is wrong |
| Is there product friction? | Maybe customers struggle with this step |
| Do they need more support? | Maybe more guidance is needed |

Recurring Signals may indicate systemic issues, not just individual customer problems.

### Measure Campaign Impact

After running Signal-driven campaigns:

- Did recipients complete faster than non-recipients?
- Did the intervention reduce the Signal population?
- What message content worked best?

This closes the loop and validates your approach.

## Prioritising Signals

When you have multiple Signals, prioritise by:

### Revenue at Risk

Higher revenue = higher priority, generally.

### Stage Importance

Early lifecycle Signals (onboarding) often deserve priority—these customers haven't yet realised value.

### Intervention Feasibility

Some Signals are easier to act on than others. A clear onboarding step is easier to nudge than a complex integration.

### Segment

If you have segments that matter more (enterprise, high-value), prioritise Signals affecting those.

## Advanced: Signal-Driven Workflows

### Automated Campaign Triggers

Instead of manually creating campaigns from Signals, you can set up campaigns that automatically target slow completers:

```
Campaign: Onboarding Objective 3 Nudge
Audience:
- currently_member_of_onboarding_stage = true
- days_in_stage >= 14
- objective_3_completed = false
```

This creates a standing campaign that catches customers as they become slow completers.

### Combining Signals with Cohorts

Create cohorts based on Signal-like criteria:

```
Cohort: Stuck in Onboarding
- currently_member_of_onboarding_stage = true
- days_in_stage >= 2x average
- objectives_completed < 50%
```

Then use this cohort for multiple purposes:
- Campaign targeting
- CSM alerts
- Executive reporting

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How often do Signals refresh?">
    Continuously as customer data updates. New slow completers appear as they cross the threshold.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I don't have enough data?">
    Signals require sufficient completions for meaningful averages. Generally 10+ completions for stability. With less data, averages are less reliable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I customize the threshold?">
    Thresholds are configured by your Trig implementation team. Future versions may expose configuration in the UI.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens when customers complete?">
    They're removed from the Signal. If they completed via campaign, the campaign tracks this as completion.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I see historical Signals?">
    Current version shows active Signals. Historical tracking is planned for future releases.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### "No Signals appearing"

- Are lifecycle stages configured and live?
- Are there objectives with completion criteria?
- Are customers in the stages?
- Are there enough completions for averages?

### "Signal customers not entering campaign"

- Does the campaign audience match the Signal criteria?
- Are there exclusions blocking entry?
- Is the campaign live?

### "Intervention not working"

- Is messaging specific to the blocker?
- Is timing right?
- Do customers understand what to do?
- Is the goal achievable?

## Summary

Using Signals effectively:

1. **Review regularly** — Check Signals daily or every few days
2. **Act quickly** — Don't let slow completers get slower
3. **Be specific** — Address the exact blocker in your messaging
4. **Measure impact** — Track whether interventions improve completion
5. **Look for patterns** — Recurring Signals may indicate systemic issues
6. **Iterate** — Use what you learn to improve future interventions

Signals transform reactive customer success into proactive intervention. Use them to catch problems before they compound.
