This guide walks you through building campaigns in Trig—from defining your goal to launching and measuring results.

## Campaign Fundamentals

Every campaign needs three things:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Goal" icon="bullseye">
    What do you want customers to do?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Audience" icon="users">
    Who should receive this intervention?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Intervention" icon="paper-plane">
    What messages will you send?
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Step 1: Define Your Goal

### What Makes a Good Goal?

Goals should be:
- **Single action** — One clear thing you want them to do
- **Measurable** — Based on an attribute or event you can track
- **Achievable** — Something the customer can realistically complete

### Goal Examples

| Campaign Type | Goal |
|--------------|------|
| Onboarding nudge | `projects_created >= 1` |
| Feature adoption | `feature_X_used >= 1` |
| Expansion | `upgrade_completed = true` |
| Churn prevention | `engagement_restored = true` |

<Warning>
**Avoid compound goals.** If you need multiple actions, create separate campaigns.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Define Your Audience

### Targeting Options

**Using attributes directly:**
```
sign_up_date > 1 day ago
AND sign_up_date < 7 days ago
AND invoices_created = 0
```

**Using cohorts:**
```
Member of cohort "New Self-Serve Users"
```

**Using Trig metadata:**
```
last_completed_Onboarding_Stage has any value
AND last_completed_First_Invoice_Campaign has no value
```

### Exclusions

Always consider who should NOT receive this campaign:

```
Audience:
- sign_up_date > 3 days ago
- invoices_created = 0

Exclusions:
- last_entered_[this_campaign] has any value  (already been through)
- currently_member_of_[other_campaign] = true  (prevent overlap)
```

### Organisation vs People

| Target | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Organisation** | Account-level decisions, commercial actions |
| **People** | Individual behaviour, specific user needs to act |

## Step 3: Set Duration

### Auto-Exit Timing

Every campaign should have an auto-exit duration:

| Action Complexity | Duration |
|------------------|----------|
| Simple (click, view) | 3-7 days |
| Moderate (setup step) | 7-14 days |
| Complex (invite team, integrate) | 14-30 days |

<Tip>
**Err shorter.** If someone hasn't responded in 14 days, another email in the same campaign probably won't help—try a different approach.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Configure Entry Actions

### Send Initial Email

The entry email is your first touch. Make it count.

**Configuration:**
- **Sender:** A real person (e.g., "Lee at FreshBooks")
- **Subject:** Specific and actionable
- **Body:** Plain text, contextual, with clear steps

**Example:**
```
Subject: Quick tip to send your first invoice

Hi {first_name},

I noticed your team at {organization_name} signed up recently
but hasn't sent an invoice yet.

Here's how to send your first one—takes about 5 minutes:

1. Click "Create Invoice" in the left menu
2. Add your client's email
3. Click Send

If you run into any issues, just reply to this email.

Thanks,
Lee
```

### Best Practices for Entry Emails

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Be specific" icon="crosshairs">
    Reference what they have and haven't done. Show you know their situation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Be actionable" icon="list-check">
    Give 1-3 clear steps. Include links where helpful.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Be brief" icon="compress">
    3-5 sentences for simple actions. No long paragraphs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Be human" icon="user">
    Plain text, from a real person, with a personal sign-off.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Step 5: Configure Follow-Up Actions

### Adding Reminders

If customers haven't completed after the initial email, send a follow-up:

```
Wait 3 days → Send follow-up email
Wait 7 days → Send second follow-up (optional)
```

### Follow-Up Email Strategy

**First follow-up (Day 3-5):**
- Reference that you've reached out before
- Try a different angle
- Shorter than the original

```
Subject: Re: Quick tip to send your first invoice

Hi {first_name},

Following up on my earlier email—I wanted to make sure you
saw the steps to send your first invoice.

If you're running into any issues, just reply and I'll help.

Thanks,
Lee
```

**Second follow-up (Day 7-10):**
- Acknowledge they might be busy
- Offer help or a call
- This is often your last automated touch

<Note>
**Most campaigns use 1-2 follow-ups.** More than that often means your campaign is too broad or goal is too ambitious.
</Note>

## Step 6: Configure Completion Actions

### What Happens on Success

When a customer achieves the goal:

**Options:**
- Send congratulations message
- Notify your team (Slack)
- Update CRM field
- Route to next campaign

**Example:**
```
Completion Actions:
├── Message Customer: "Great job sending your first invoice!"
├── Notify Team: "#wins - {organization_name} completed onboarding"
└── Update Attribute: completed_onboarding_campaign = true
```

### Silent Completion

Not every campaign needs a completion message. For feature adoption campaigns, silent completion is often appropriate.

## Step 7: Configure Exit Actions

### What Happens on Failure

When a customer exits without completing:

**Options:**
- Notify team for manual follow-up
- Update attribute for tracking
- Route to alternative campaign

**Example:**
```
Exit Actions:
├── Notify Team: "@{csm_email} - {organization_name} failed onboarding, needs follow-up"
└── Update Attribute: failed_onboarding_campaign = true
```

### Chaining to Alternate Campaigns

Use exit actions to create branching journeys:

```
Campaign: Onboarding Nudge v1
├── Completed → Route to "Feature Adoption" campaign
└── Exited → Route to "Onboarding Nudge v2" (different approach)
```

## Step 8: Review and Launch

### Pre-Launch Checklist

<Check>Goal is clear and measurable</Check>
<Check>Audience returns expected customers</Check>
<Check>Duration is appropriate for the action</Check>
<Check>Entry email is specific, actionable, and human</Check>
<Check>Follow-ups are spaced appropriately</Check>
<Check>Completion and exit actions configured</Check>
<Check>Exclusions prevent re-entry and overlap</Check>

### Launch the Campaign

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review configuration">
    Double-check all settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check audience size">
    Verify the number of customers who will enter
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch">
    Click **Go Live**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor">
    Watch the first few days for issues
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Campaign Chaining Patterns

### Success Path

After completing Campaign 1, move to Campaign 2:

```
Campaign 2 Audience:
- last_completed_Campaign_1 has any value
- [next action criteria]
```

### Failure Path

After failing Campaign 1, try Campaign 1B:

```
Campaign 1B Audience:
- last_exited_Campaign_1 has any value
- last_completed_Campaign_1 has no value
```

### Progressive Journey

```
Welcome → Onboarding → Feature Adoption → Expansion
   ↓           ↓              ↓
Retry A    Retry B        CSM Outreach
```

## Measuring Campaign Effectiveness

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Completion rate** | Completed / (Completed + Exited) | 20-40% |
| **Time to completion** | Avg days to complete | As fast as possible |
| **Entry to exit rate** | Exited / Total entered | Lower is better |

### What to Optimise

| If... | Then... |
|-------|---------|
| Low completion rate | Adjust messaging, timing, or goal |
| Long time to completion | Intervention may be too early |
| High exit at specific point | Focus messaging there |
| Certain segments complete more | Target them specifically |

## Common Campaign Patterns

### Onboarding Nudge

```
Goal: first_project_created >= 1
Audience: signup 1-7 days ago, no project created
Duration: 10 days
Entry: Plain text email with steps
Follow-up: Day 3, Day 7
Completion: Notify team
Exit: Route to "Onboarding Stalled" campaign
```

### Feature Adoption

```
Goal: feature_X_used >= 1
Audience: Premium plan, never used feature X, 30+ days old
Duration: 14 days
Entry: Email highlighting feature value
Follow-up: Day 5 with different angle
Completion: Silent
Exit: Flag for CSM
```

### Churn Prevention

```
Goal: engagement_restored = true
Audience: renewal in 90 days, no login in 30 days
Duration: 30 days
Entry: Personal outreach from CSM
Follow-up: Week 2, Week 3
Completion: Notify sales
Exit: Escalate to sales
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Campaign isn't sending emails"

- Is the campaign live (not paused)?
- Are there customers matching the audience?
- Is email integration configured?
- Is the sender verified?

### "Wrong customers entering"

- Review audience criteria
- Check for typos in attribute names
- Verify date logic (before/after)

### "Low completion rate"

- Is the goal achievable?
- Is messaging specific enough?
- Is timing right (too early? too late?)
- Are you targeting the right audience?

## Summary

Building effective campaigns:

1. **Clear goal** — Single, measurable action
2. **Right audience** — Specific targeting with exclusions
3. **Appropriate duration** — Time-bounded, err shorter
4. **Human messaging** — Plain text, specific, actionable
5. **Strategic follow-ups** — 1-2 max, vary the angle
6. **Complete the loop** — Actions on both completion and exit
7. **Chain thoughtfully** — Build progressive journeys

Well-designed campaigns turn insight into action and create measurable impact on customer success.
