This guide walks you through configuring lifecycle stages for your business—from planning your customer journey to launching live stages with objectives.

## Before You Start

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have:
- **Data integrations connected** — CRM and product data flowing into Trig
- **Organisations in Trig** — Customer accounts visible in the Audience view
- **Internal alignment** — Agreement on what your customer journey looks like

### Planning Questions

Before creating stages, answer these for each stage of your journey:

| Question | Example Answer |
|----------|---------------|
| What period does this stage cover? | Days 1-30 after signup |
| What happens in this stage? | Initial setup, first value |
| How do customers enter? | First seen date within 30 days |
| How do customers exit? | After 30 days OR all objectives complete |
| What 4-7 milestones matter? | Created project, invited team, connected integration |

## Step 1: Map Your Customer Journey

### Identify Your Stages

Most B2B SaaS companies use four stages:

```
Onboarding → Adoption → Expansion → Renewal
```

For each stage, define:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Scope">
    What period of the journey? How long does it typically last?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Entry">
    What triggers entry? Time-based, event-based, or completion of previous stage?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Objectives">
    What 4-7 milestones define healthy progression?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Exit">
    When does this stage end? Completion-based, time-based, or hybrid?
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example: Onboarding Stage

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | Onboarding |
| **Duration** | Days 0-30 |
| **Entry criteria** | `first_seen_date` within last 30 days |
| **Exit criteria** | Time-based: Auto-exit after 30 days |
| **Objectives** | Created first project, Invited team member, Connected integration, Generated first report |

## Step 2: Create Your First Stage

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Lifecycle Stages">
    Go to **Lifecycle > Stages** in the main navigation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create new stage">
    Click **Create Stage** and enter:
    - **Name:** Onboarding
    - **Description:** Initial setup and first value milestones
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure entry criteria">
    Define when organisations enter:
    ```
    first_seen_date is within last 30 days
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure exit criteria">
    For your first stage, use time-based exit:
    ```
    Auto-exit after 30 days
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the stage">
    Review and save. Don't launch yet—add objectives first.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Start with time-based exit.** You can refine to completion-based exit once you understand typical customer patterns.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Add Objectives

### Identify 4-7 Key Milestones

For each stage, identify the actions that indicate healthy progression:

**Onboarding stage example:**
- Created first project
- Invited a team member
- Connected an integration
- Generated first report
- Completed a full week of usage

### Create Each Objective

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your stage">
    Click into the stage you just created
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add objective">
    Click **Add Objective** and configure:
    - **Name:** Created First Project
    - **Completion criteria:** `projects_created >= 1`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Repeat">
    Add 3-5 additional objectives with clear completion criteria
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Completion Criteria Examples

| Objective | Criteria |
|-----------|----------|
| Created First Project | `projects_created >= 1` |
| Invited Team Member | `team_members >= 2` |
| Connected Integration | `integrations_connected >= 1` |
| Generated First Report | `reports_generated >= 1` |
| Completed Full Week | `days_with_activity >= 7` |

### Objective Best Practices

<Warning>
**Keep objectives simple.** Each objective should track one clear milestone. Complex objectives with multiple AND conditions are harder to interpret.
</Warning>

**Good objective:**
```
Name: Created First Project
Criteria: projects_created >= 1
```

**Too complex:**
```
Name: Fully Onboarded
Criteria: projects_created >= 1 AND team_members >= 2 AND integrations >= 1
```

Better as three separate objectives.

## Step 4: Configure Additional Stages

### Create Adoption Stage

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | Adoption |
| **Entry** | `last_completed_onboarding_stage` has any value |
| **Exit** | Auto-exit after 90 days |
| **Objectives** | Feature depth, Team growth, Regular usage |

### Create Expansion Stage

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | Expansion |
| **Entry** | `last_completed_adoption_stage` has any value |
| **Exit** | Ongoing (no auto-exit) |
| **Objectives** | Premium feature exploration, Seat utilisation, Upgrade signals |

### Create Renewal Stage

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | Renewal |
| **Entry** | `renewal_date` within 90 days |
| **Exit** | Renewal complete or churned |
| **Objectives** | Engagement maintained, Health score stable, Renewal confirmed |

## Step 5: Validate Before Launch

### Check Data Availability

For each objective, confirm:
- The event or attribute exists in your data
- It's flowing into Trig correctly
- It updates when customers take the action

### Review Audience Size

In the stage configuration:
- Check how many organisations would enter
- Verify this matches your expectations
- Spot-check individual organisations

### Test with Sample Organisations

Look at 3-5 specific organisations:
- Would they enter this stage correctly?
- Would objectives mark complete when expected?
- Are there edge cases you haven't considered?

## Step 6: Launch Your Stages

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review configuration">
    Double-check entry criteria, exit criteria, and all objectives
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch the stage">
    Click **Go Live** to activate the stage
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor initial data">
    Watch the first few days to ensure:
    - Organisations are entering correctly
    - Objectives are completing as expected
    - No unexpected edge cases
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After Launch

### Monitor Key Metrics

In the first few weeks, watch:

| Metric | What to Look For |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Entry rate** | Are organisations entering as expected? |
| **Objective completion** | Are objectives completing when they should? |
| **Average times** | Are averages building as data accumulates? |
| **Edge cases** | Any organisations stuck unexpectedly? |

### Refine Based on Data

After 2-4 weeks, review:

- **Objectives with 0% completion:** Maybe too hard or wrong criteria
- **Objectives with 100% instant completion:** Maybe too easy or automatic
- **Objectives that predict success:** Prioritise in interventions
- **Objectives that predict churn:** Add early warning campaigns

### Iterate

Lifecycle stages improve over time:
- Add new objectives as you learn what matters
- Adjust thresholds that are too easy or hard
- Remove objectives that provide no signal
- Refine exit criteria based on observed patterns

## Common Configuration Patterns

### PLG / Self-Serve

```
Stage: Onboarding
Entry: first_seen_date within 14 days
Exit: Auto-exit after 14 days
Duration: Short, focused

Objectives:
- Completed signup flow
- Explored core feature
- Returned second day
- Invited first team member
```

### Sales-Led / Enterprise

```
Stage: Onboarding
Entry: contract_signed = true
Exit: All objectives complete OR 60 days
Duration: Longer, more objectives

Objectives:
- Kickoff call completed
- Admin users configured
- SSO connected
- First use case deployed
- Training completed
- Business owner engaged
```

### Hybrid

```
Stage: Onboarding
Entry: first_seen_date within 30 days
Exit: Auto-exit after 30 days

Objectives vary by segment:
- Self-serve: 4 objectives, simpler criteria
- Sales-led: 6 objectives, include manual steps
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No organisations entering stage"

- Check entry criteria—are they correct?
- Verify data is flowing for the criteria attributes
- Confirm organisations exist that should match

### "Objectives not completing"

- Verify the attribute/event name is correct
- Check that data is updating when customers act
- Test with a known customer who should have completed

### "Too many organisations stuck"

- Review exit criteria—is there a path forward?
- Consider time-based exit as safety net
- Check if objectives are too difficult

## Summary

Configuring lifecycle stages:

1. **Plan first** — Map your journey, identify stages and objectives
2. **Start simple** — One stage with 4-5 objectives, time-based exit
3. **Verify data** — Ensure attributes exist and flow correctly
4. **Launch and monitor** — Watch initial data, catch issues early
5. **Iterate** — Refine based on observed patterns

Once configured, lifecycle stages become the foundation for pattern discovery, Signals, and campaign interventions.
