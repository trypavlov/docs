Objectives are specific milestones or behaviours that you want to track within a lifecycle stage. They represent the things you expect customers to do as they progress—the actions that indicate healthy usage and forward momentum.

## What Are Objectives?

Objectives are the checkpoints along a journey. Each checkpoint answers:
- "Has this customer done this thing yet?"
- "How long did it take them compared to others?"

<Note>
**Key distinction:** Objectives are observational. They track whether something happened without necessarily triggering an intervention. You're building a picture of what customers are doing, how quickly, and who is ahead or behind.
</Note>

## Objectives vs Markers

Within lifecycle stages, Trig distinguishes between two types:

| Objectives | Markers |
|------------|---------|
| Things you *want* customers to do | Signals of healthy usage |
| Milestones you've identified as important | Ongoing behaviours that correlate with success |
| Define the destination | Indicate quality of the journey |

**Objective examples:**
- Created first project
- Invited a team member
- Connected payment gateway

**Marker examples:**
- Logged in more than 3 times this week
- Session duration greater than 10 minutes
- Returned within 24 hours

## Why Objectives Matter

### Building a Picture of Normal

Every objective contributes to understanding what "normal" looks like:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Average time to complete** | How long does the typical customer take? |
| **Completion rate** | What percentage complete this objective? |
| **Completion sequence** | In what order do customers typically complete? |

This baseline builds automatically as data accumulates.

### Identifying Who Needs Attention

Once normal is established, every organisation can be measured:

- **Faster than average** — Completed more quickly than typical
- **Slower than average** — Taking longer, potentially stuck
- **Not completed** — Should have completed by now but hasn't

This comparison is the foundation for [Signals](/concepts/signals).

### Enabling Pattern Discovery

Objectives create measurement points for analysis:

- "Customers who complete Objective A within 7 days have 80% higher retention"
- "Customers who skip Objective C rarely complete Objective D"
- "The median time to complete all onboarding objectives is 12 days"

## How Objectives Work

### Relationship to Lifecycle Stages

Objectives always live within a lifecycle stage. They inherit their audience from the stage—if an organisation is in the stage, it's being tracked against the stage's objectives.

```
Lifecycle Stage: Onboarding
├── Objective 1: Created First Project
├── Objective 2: Invited Team Member
├── Objective 3: Connected Integration
├── Objective 4: Generated First Report
└── Objective 5: Completed Full Week of Usage
```

### Non-Linear Completion

Objectives do not need to be completed in order. Unless your business logic requires a specific sequence, customers can complete in any order.

This matters because:
- Different customers have different priorities
- Forcing linear completion creates artificial friction
- The insight is often *which* objectives get completed first

<Tip>
If you need to enforce sequence (Objective B requires Objective A), build that into the completion criteria.
</Tip>

### Completion Tracking

When an objective is completed, Trig records:

| Data Point | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Completion timestamp** | When the objective was achieved |
| **Time from stage entry** | Days since entering the stage |
| **Comparison to average** | Faster or slower than typical |

This data becomes metadata on the organisation for filtering, targeting, and analysis.

## Configuring Objectives

### Anatomy of an Objective

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Name** | Descriptive name for the milestone | "First Invoice Created" |
| **Audience** | Who this applies to (usually inherited) | All orgs in stage |
| **Completion Criteria** | What indicates done | `invoices_created >= 1` |

### Completion Criteria Options

**Attribute-based:**
```
attribute = specific_value
attribute >= X
attribute has any value
```

**Event-based:**
```
event_count >= X
event occurred
```

**Combination:**
```
condition_1 AND condition_2
condition_1 OR condition_2
```

### Keep Objectives Simple

<Warning>
Each objective should track one meaningful milestone. Complex objectives with many AND conditions are harder to interpret and optimise.
</Warning>

**Too complex:**
```
invoices_created >= 3 AND
payment_gateway_connected = true AND
team_members >= 2 AND
first_payment_received = true
```

**Better as separate objectives:**
- First 3 Invoices Created
- Payment Gateway Connected
- Team Collaboration Started
- First Payment Received

### Naming Conventions

Good objective names are:
- **Descriptive** — Clear what the milestone is
- **Action-oriented** — Describes what the customer did
- **Threshold-inclusive** — Include numbers if relevant

| Good | Bad |
|------|-----|
| "Created First Invoice" | "Invoice" |
| "Using Projects (3+)" | "Projects" |
| "Team Member Invited" | "Has team" |

### Threshold Objectives

Track not just whether something happened, but how much:

```
Objective: Using Manual Journal Entries (First Time)
Completion: manual_journal_entries >= 1

Objective: Using Manual Journal Entries (5+)
Completion: manual_journal_entries >= 5

Objective: Using Manual Journal Entries (20+)
Completion: manual_journal_entries >= 20
```

This reveals:
- How many customers use the feature at all
- How many become moderate users
- How many become power users

## Objectives and Signals

### How Signals Use Objectives

The [Signals](/concepts/signals) feature analyses objective performance and identifies organisations that need attention:

1. Trig calculates average time to complete each objective
2. For each organisation, Trig compares time-in-stage to the average
3. Organisations significantly behind are flagged as slow completers
4. These appear in the Signals panel for review and action

**Example:**
- Average time to complete "First Invoice Created": 7 days
- Organisation X has been in stage for 14 days, hasn't completed it
- Organisation X appears as a slow completer

### From Signal to Action

1. **Signal surfaces organisations** — "47 organisations are overdue on 'First Invoice'"
2. **You review and decide** — Worth intervening? What should we say?
3. **Create campaign** — Target these organisations
4. **Measure impact** — Did the intervention improve completion?

## Viewing Objective Performance

### Stage-Level View

Within a lifecycle stage, see aggregate performance:

- Total organisations in stage
- Completion counts per objective
- Average time to complete
- Week-over-week trends

### Organisation-Level View

For an individual organisation:

```
Organisation: Acme Corp (entered Day 0, currently Day 21)

Objective 1: First Invoice Created
├── ✓ Completed (Day 3)
├── △ Average: Day 7
└── Status: AHEAD (4 days faster)

Objective 2: Payment Gateway Connected
├── ✗ Not completed
├── △ Average: Day 14
└── Status: BEHIND (7 days overdue)
```

## Objectives vs Stage Completion

**Stage completion criteria** determine when an organisation exits the stage.

**Objectives** track progress within the stage.

### Options

| Approach | Description | Trade-off |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Objectives match completion** | Stage completes when all objectives done | Risk: orgs can get stuck forever |
| **Time-based completion** | Stage completes after X days | Everyone moves forward, completion rates vary |
| **Hybrid** | Time-based OR key objectives complete | Balance movement and measurement |

Most implementations use time-based or hybrid.

## Best Practices

### Start with 4-7 Objectives Per Stage

Too few = lack granularity. Too many = noise overwhelms signal.

### Define Objectives You Can Track

Only create objectives where you have data. Confirm:
- The event or attribute exists
- It's flowing into Trig correctly
- It updates when the customer acts

### Make Objectives Meaningful

Objectives should represent meaningful milestones, but don't need to be important enough to email about:

**Good:** "Created 6 or more pages" — Meaningful engagement indicator, worth tracking

The intervention decision comes later, informed by patterns across your customer base.

### Use Objectives to Find Bottlenecks

If Objective A has 90% completion and Objective B has 10%, you've found a bottleneck. Design objectives to reveal where customers get stuck.

### Review and Refine

Once objectives are live and accumulating data:

- Are any objectives never completed? (Maybe too hard)
- Are any always completed instantly? (Maybe too easy)
- Is there an objective that predicts success?
- Is there an objective that predicts churn?

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I add objectives after the stage is live?">
    Yes. Existing organisations will simply have no completion data for new objectives.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I modify completion criteria after it's live?">
    Yes, but changing criteria may affect historical interpretation. If you change "invoices >= 1" to "invoices >= 3", previously completed orgs may now show incomplete.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if an objective is never completed?">
    The organisation shows as incomplete. With time-based stage exit, they still move forward—just with incomplete objectives recorded.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How long before averages are reliable?">
    With 50+ completions, averages become meaningful. With 200+, statistically significant.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should objectives be linear?">
    By default, non-linear. If you need enforced sequence, build dependency into completion criteria.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Summary

Objectives are the measurement checkpoints within lifecycle stages:

1. **Observational** — Track what happened, not what to do about it
2. **Keep them simple** — One clear milestone per objective
3. **Non-linear by default** — Customers can complete in any order
4. **Build toward patterns** — Value compounds as data accumulates
5. **Feed into Signals** — Slow completers become intervention targets

Configure objectives thoughtfully, let data accumulate, and use the patterns to drive intelligent interventions.
