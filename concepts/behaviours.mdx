Behaviours are defined patterns of customer activity that you want to track and potentially act upon. They capture the moment when a customer exhibits a specific combination of attributes or events that matters to your business.

## What Are Behaviours?

Think of behaviours as tripwires. You define the conditions, and when a customer crosses that threshold, Trig records it, can fire actions, and creates permanent metadata about when it happened.

<Note>
**Key characteristic:** Behaviours are **one and done**. Once a customer enters a behaviour and either completes it or exits, they cannot re-enter that same behaviour again.
</Note>

This makes behaviours ideal for tracking milestone moments—things that happen once and carry significance.

## Behaviours vs Cohorts

Understanding this distinction is critical:

| Behaviours | Cohorts |
|------------|---------|
| One and done—once you leave, you can never re-enter | Dynamic—you can enter and leave multiple times |
| Track milestone moments that happen once | Track current state based on criteria |
| Create permanent historical record | Membership changes as attributes change |
| "First time they did X" | "Currently active" |

**Example comparison:**

A **"Super User" behaviour** captures the moment someone first becomes a super user. Once achieved, it's recorded permanently—even if usage later declines.

A **"Super User" cohort** tracks who currently meets super user criteria. If usage declines, they leave. If it rises, they rejoin.

Both have value. Behaviours give you historical milestones. Cohorts give you current state.

## Why Behaviours Matter

### Capturing Milestone Moments

Some customer actions are significant precisely because they happen once:

- First time creating a project
- Reaching a usage threshold (100+ actions)
- Completing a critical setup step
- Achieving "power user" criteria

### Triggering Actions at the Right Time

When a customer exhibits a behaviour, you can immediately:
- Notify your team via Slack or webhook
- Update an attribute in your system
- Send a follow-up communication
- Route them into a campaign

### Building Customer Context

Every behaviour creates metadata:

```
last_entered_[behaviour]     — When they entered
last_completed_[behaviour]   — When they completed
last_exited_[behaviour]      — When they exited without completing
currently_member_of_[behaviour] — Whether they're currently in it
```

This metadata is available for targeting, filtering, and analysis throughout the platform.

### Qualifying Audiences for Campaigns

Behaviours are often used as qualification criteria:

```
Target everyone who has completed "Setup Complete" behaviour
but has NOT completed "First Project Created" behaviour
```

## How Behaviours Work

### Entry Criteria (Audience)

Entry criteria define who qualifies to enter:

```
Behaviour: First Strike Moment
Audience:
  - License type = commercial
  - First session date within last 7 days
```

When someone matches these criteria and hasn't previously entered, they enter the behaviour.

### Completion Criteria

Completion criteria define success:

```
Completion criteria:
  - Projects created >= 1 OR
  - Boards joined >= 1 OR
  - Project link clicked >= 1
```

When someone in the behaviour meets these criteria, they complete. Completion is the positive outcome.

### Exit Without Completion

If someone is in a behaviour and no longer matches entry criteria (or a time limit passes) without completing, they exit. Exit is the negative outcome.

### The One-and-Done Rule

Once a customer has entered a behaviour—regardless of completion or exit—they cannot enter again.

This serves important purposes:
- Preserves integrity of "first time" tracking
- Prevents double-counting
- Creates clean historical records

<Tip>
If you need to track something that can happen repeatedly, use a cohort instead, or create multiple behaviours with different criteria.
</Tip>

## Configuring Behaviours

### Anatomy of a Behaviour

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Name** | Descriptive name | "Setup Moment Reached" |
| **Audience** | Who qualifies to enter | License = commercial, first session within 7 days |
| **Completion Criteria** | What indicates success | Created project >= 1 |
| **Entry Actions** | What happens on entry | Notify team, update attribute |
| **Completion Actions** | What happens on completion | Send webhook, update CRM |
| **Exit Actions** | What happens on exit without completion | Notify team of drop-off |

### Building Entry Criteria

Entry criteria use filter logic:

**Attribute-based:**
```
attribute = value
attribute >= X
attribute has any value
```

**Trig metadata:**
```
currently_member_of_[stage/behaviour/campaign]
last_completed_[stage/behaviour/campaign] has any value
```

<Warning>
**Important:** Attributes are evaluated historically—existing values are checked. Events are evaluated forward—only new events trigger.
</Warning>

### Entry, Completion, and Exit Actions

**Notify team:**
- Send Slack message to a channel
- Include customer context

**Fire webhook:**
- Call an external endpoint
- Pass customer data

**Update attribute:**
- Set an internal attribute
- Flag status changes

## Common Behaviour Patterns

### Milestone Behaviours

Track significant first-time achievements:

```
Behaviour: First Project Created
Audience: All customers
Completion: projects_created >= 1

Behaviour: Power User Threshold Reached
Audience: All customers
Completion:
  - sessions_per_week >= 5 AND
  - features_used >= 7 AND
  - team_members >= 3
```

### Funnel Stage Behaviours

Track progression through a conversion funnel:

```
Behaviour: Setup Moment
Audience: License = trial
Completion: setup_completed = true

Behaviour: Aha Moment
Audience: completed Setup Moment
Completion: first_value_action = true

Behaviour: Habit Moment
Audience: completed Aha Moment
Completion: return_visits >= 3
```

Each behaviour's audience can depend on completing the previous one.

### Alert Behaviours

Track conditions that should trigger notification:

```
Behaviour: Ultra Superstar User
Audience: All customers
Completion:
  - projects_created >= 10 AND
  - boards_created >= 10 AND
  - users_invited >= 100
Entry Action: Notify sales team in Slack
```

### Negative Behaviours

Track concerning patterns:

```
Behaviour: Dropped Off During Onboarding
Audience:
  - In onboarding stage
  - Days since first session >= 14
Completion:
  - Last login > 7 days ago
  - Onboarding objectives completed < 2
Entry Action: Alert CSM
```

## Behaviours as Objectives

Within lifecycle stages, objectives are actually behaviours under the hood:

```
Lifecycle Stage: Onboarding
├── Objective: Created First Invoice (behaviour)
├── Objective: Connected Gateway (behaviour)
├── Objective: Invited Team Member (behaviour)
```

The mechanics are identical—entry criteria, completion criteria, actions. Within a lifecycle stage context, they're called "objectives" and contribute to stage progression tracking.

## Automatic Metadata

When you create a behaviour, Trig generates attributes automatically:

| Attribute | Type |
|-----------|------|
| `currently_member_of_[behaviour]` | Boolean |
| `last_entered_[behaviour]` | Timestamp |
| `last_exited_[behaviour]` | Timestamp |
| `last_completed_[behaviour]` | Timestamp |

You don't need to create these manually.

### Using Behaviour Metadata

```
Campaign Audience:
  - last_completed_Setup_Moment has any value
  - last_completed_Aha_Moment has no value
```

This targets everyone who completed setup but hasn't reached their aha moment.

## Best Practices

### Name Behaviours Clearly

| Good | Bad |
|------|-----|
| "First Invoice Created" | "Behaviour 1" |
| "Setup Moment Reached" | "Test" |
| "Power User Threshold" | "PU" |

### Keep Behaviours Focused

Each behaviour should track one meaningful milestone.

**Too complex:**
```
Completion:
  - invoices >= 3 AND
  - payments >= 1 AND
  - team_members >= 2 AND
  - integrations >= 1
```

**Better as separate behaviours:**
- "First 3 Invoices Created"
- "First Payment Received"
- "Team Collaboration Started"
- "Integration Connected"

### Use Behaviours for "First Time" Tracking

The one-and-done nature makes behaviours perfect for first-time events.

### Plan Sequences Carefully

Because behaviours can't be re-entered, plan thoughtfully:
1. Define each stage as a separate behaviour
2. Use completion of previous as entry criteria for next
3. Consider what happens to people who skip stages

### Don't Duplicate Trig Metadata

You don't need to create "entered_X = true" attributes manually—Trig creates them automatically.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I edit a behaviour after it's live?">
    You can, but changing criteria affects historical interpretation. Better to create a new behaviour with updated criteria.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why can't customers re-enter behaviours?">
    The one-and-done design preserves milestone tracking integrity. Use cohorts for repeated entry.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I track something that happens multiple times?">
    Use threshold behaviours: "First time", "5+ times", "10+ times" as separate behaviours. Or use cohorts for current state.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between a behaviour and an objective?">
    Objectives are behaviours within lifecycle stages. Same mechanics, but objectives carry additional meaning for stage progression.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do behaviour actions fire immediately?">
    Yes. Entry, completion, and exit actions fire as soon as the condition is met.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can behaviours use events from the past?">
    Events are forward-only. Attributes are historical.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Summary

Behaviours capture milestone moments in the customer journey:

1. **One and done** — Customers can only enter each behaviour once
2. **Trigger actions** — Notify teams, fire webhooks, update attributes
3. **Build context** — Every behaviour creates permanent metadata
4. **Qualify audiences** — Use behaviour history for downstream targeting
5. **Sequence thoughtfully** — Plan behaviour dependencies carefully

Used well, behaviours create a rich tapestry of customer context that powers intelligent, timely interventions.
