Actions are the things Trig does in response to customer activity. They're the "do something" layer of the platform—executing interventions, sending notifications, updating systems, and communicating with customers.

## What Are Actions?

Every campaign, behaviour, and lifecycle stage can trigger actions at key moments. Actions turn insight into intervention.

**Core principle:** Trig observes customer behaviour, identifies when intervention is needed, and actions execute that intervention.

## When Actions Trigger

Actions fire at specific moments:

### Entry Actions

Fire when a customer enters a campaign, behaviour, or lifecycle stage.

**Use for:**
- Sending initial outreach
- Notifying your team
- Recording entry in CRM

### Completion Actions (Follow-Up)

Fire when a customer achieves the goal.

**Use for:**
- Congratulating customers
- Notifying team of success
- Recording completion in CRM
- Triggering next-stage campaigns

### Exit Actions (Fallback)

Fire when a customer exits without completing.

**Use for:**
- Notifying team of intervention failure
- Recording failure in CRM
- Triggering escalation or alternative campaigns
- Alerting CSMs for manual follow-up

## Action Types

### Message Customer

Send an email directly to the customer.

| Configuration | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Sender** | Who the email appears from |
| **Subject** | Email subject line |
| **Body** | Email content with dynamic attributes |
| **Format** | Plain text recommended |

**Example:**
```
From: Anna at Autodesk
Subject: Quick tip to get started

Hi {first_name},

I noticed you joined {board_name} but haven't created your
first project yet. Here are three steps to get started—takes
about 5 minutes.

[steps]

Thanks,
Anna
```

### Send Reminder Message

Send a follow-up email after a delay if the customer hasn't completed.

| Configuration | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Delay** | Wait X days before sending |
| **Content** | Same as message customer |

**Example sequence:**
1. Entry: Send initial email
2. Wait 5 days
3. If not completed: Send reminder
4. Wait 5 more days
5. If still not completed: Exit with fallback actions

### Notify Team

Send a notification to your internal team via Slack.

| Configuration | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Channel** | Select Slack channel |
| **Message** | Notification content with dynamic attributes |

**Example:**
```
Channel: #customer-alerts
Message: @{case_owner_email} - {organization_name} has entered
the "At Risk" campaign. They haven't logged in for 30+ days.
```

<Tip>
**Dynamic @-mentions:** Include an email attribute with @ to ping that person directly in Slack.
</Tip>

### Update Attribute

Set or update an attribute value on the customer record.

| Configuration | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Attribute name** | Which field to update |
| **Value** | What value to set |

**Example:**
```
Attribute: completed_onboarding_campaign
Value: true
```

<Warning>
If you update an attribute that's also synced from CRM, the next sync may overwrite your update. Use Trig-specific fields.
</Warning>

## Dynamic Attributes in Messages

Actions can include dynamic content from customer attributes.

### How to Use

In any message field, insert attribute placeholders:

```
Hi {first_name},

I noticed your team at {organization_name} signed up
{days_since_signup} days ago but hasn't {specific_action} yet.

Here's how to get started: [link]

Thanks,
{sender_name}
```

### Available Attributes

Any attribute on the customer record:
- **Person attributes:** first_name, email, role
- **Organisation attributes:** organization_name, industry, arr
- **Trig-generated:** last_entry_to_campaign, days_in_stage
- **CRM attributes:** case_owner_email, account_manager

### Handling Missing Values

If an attribute has no value, the placeholder will be empty. Test messages with real customer data to ensure correct rendering.

## Email Configuration

### Integration Setup

Before sending emails, you need:
1. **Domain verification:** DNS records to authorise sending
2. **Sender configuration:** Who emails appear from
3. **Subdomain setup:** Often use a subdomain for deliverability

This is handled during onboarding.

### Sender Identity

Emails should appear from a real person:

| Good | Bad |
|------|-----|
| "Anna at Autodesk" | "no-reply@autodesk.com" |
| anna@notifications.autodesk.com | "Autodesk Marketing" |

Personal senders get higher engagement.

### Plain Text vs HTML

<Warning>
**Strong recommendation: Use plain text.**
</Warning>

| Plain Text | HTML/Branded |
|------------|--------------|
| Looks like from a real person | Looks like marketing automation |
| Higher open rates | Lower open rates |
| Higher response rates | Lower response rates |
| Avoids spam filters | More likely filtered |

## Slack Integration

### Setup

1. Authorise Trig to access your Slack workspace
2. Wait for channel enumeration
3. Select channels for notifications

### Channel Selection

Target channels like:
- #customer-success
- #sales-alerts
- #trig-notifications

### Message Formatting

Slack messages support:
- Dynamic attributes (same as email)
- @-mentions using email addresses
- Basic formatting

## Using Attributes to Chain Campaigns

Actions that update attributes enable campaign chaining:

```
Campaign 1: Try to get customer to do X
├── On completion: Set "completed_campaign_1" = true
└── On exit: Set "failed_campaign_1" = true

Campaign 2: Target completers
└── Audience: "completed_campaign_1" = true

Campaign 1B: Alternative for failures
└── Audience: "failed_campaign_1" = true
```

## Campaign Action Flow Example

```
Campaign: Onboarding Nudge
├── Entry Actions
│   ├── Message Customer: Welcome email with steps
│   └── Update Attribute: entered_onboarding_nudge = true
│
├── Intervention (if not completed)
│   └── Send Reminder: Wait 5 days, send follow-up
│
├── Completion Actions (Follow-Up)
│   ├── Message Customer: Congratulations, here's what's next
│   ├── Notify Team: Customer completed onboarding
│   └── Update Attribute: completed_onboarding = true
│
└── Exit Actions (Fallback)
    ├── Notify Team: Customer failed, needs manual follow-up
    └── Update Attribute: failed_onboarding = true
```

## Action Availability by Context

| Action | Entry | Completion | Exit |
|--------|-------|------------|------|
| Message Customer | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Send Reminder | ✓ | — | — |
| Notify Team | ✓* | ✓ | ✓ |
| Update Attribute | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

*May have constraints depending on configuration

## Best Practices

### Email Content

**Be specific and actionable:**
```
Good: "Click here to complete your profile. It takes 2 minutes."
Bad: "We noticed you haven't finished setting up your account."
```

**Include clear steps:**
```
Here are three steps to send your first invoice:
1. Click "Create Invoice" in the left menu
2. Add your client's email address
3. Click Send

That's it—you'll get a notification when they pay.
```

**Keep it short:**
- 3-5 sentences for simple actions
- Bullet points for multi-step instructions
- No long paragraphs

### Notification Strategy

**Don't over-notify:**
- Reserve notifications for high-value or high-risk situations
- Use channels, not DMs, for most notifications
- Not every entry needs a Slack notification

**Route appropriately:**
- High-value customers → Dedicated channel + @-mention
- Routine updates → Team channel without @-mention
- Escalations → Specific person @-mentioned

### Attribute Management

**Name clearly:**
- `completed_onboarding_campaign` not `flag_1`
- `last_intervention_date` not `date`

**Don't overwrite CRM fields:**
- Create dedicated Trig fields in your CRM
- Coordinate with CRM admin on write-back strategy

### Testing

**Before going live:**
- Test with small audience
- Verify dynamic attributes render correctly
- Check Slack notifications reach correct channel
- Confirm CRM updates work

**Monitor after launch:**
- Check delivery rates
- Watch for bounces or spam issues
- Verify customers progressing as expected

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending

Check:
- Email integration configured?
- Sender verified?
- DNS records in place?
- Campaign active (not paused)?

### Slack Notifications Not Appearing

Check:
- Slack integration connected?
- Channel enumeration complete?
- Correct channel selected?
- Bot has permission to post?

### Attributes Not Updating

Check:
- Correct attribute name?
- Attribute exists in system?
- Action actually triggered?
- CRM sync overwriting value?

## Summary

Actions are how Trig turns insight into intervention:

1. **Three trigger points** — Entry, completion, and exit each serve different purposes
2. **Four action types** — Message customer, send reminder, notify team, update attribute
3. **Plain text wins** — Simple, personal emails outperform branded marketing
4. **Chain with attributes** — Use attribute updates to create progressive campaign sequences
5. **Right action, right moment** — Entry for initial outreach, completion for celebration, exit for escalation
