Attributes are data points that describe your customers. They're the building blocks of everything in Trig—defining audiences, setting completion criteria, personalising messages, and tracking progress.

## What Are Attributes?

Think of attributes as facts you know about each customer:
- Who they are (name, email, role)
- What they've done (signup date, invoices created, login count)
- Where they are in their journey (lifecycle stage, campaign membership)
- What Trig has observed (days in stage, objectives completed)

Every filter, audience, and criteria in Trig is built from attributes.

## Attribute Types

### Ingested Attributes

Pulled from external systems into Trig.

**Sources:**
- **CRM:** HubSpot, Salesforce
- **Data warehouse:** Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift
- **Product analytics:** Mixpanel, Amplitude, Segment, Pendo

**Examples:**
- `company_name` (from HubSpot)
- `arr` (from Salesforce)
- `signup_date` (from product database)
- `plan_type` (from billing system)

### Trig Activity Attributes (Auto-Generated)

Created automatically as customers interact with Trig objects.

For every campaign, behaviour, stage, and objective:
```
currently_member_of_[object_name]  — Are they currently in?
last_entry_to_[object_name]        — When did they enter?
last_exit_from_[object_name]       — When did they exit (failed)?
last_completion_of_[object_name]   — When did they complete?
```

**Examples:**
```
currently_member_of_onboarding_stage = true
last_entry_to_poc_1_campaign = 2024-10-15
last_completion_of_create_first_invoice = 2024-10-18
```

These attributes persist forever—you can always look back at which campaigns and stages a customer has been through.

### Rolled-Up Attributes

Aggregated from child entities (People) to parent entities (Organisations).

| Aggregation | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| **Sum** | Total logins across all users |
| **Count** | Number of users matching criteria |
| **Average** | Mean value across users |
| **Min/Max** | Extremes across users |

**Examples:**
- `total_time_entries_created` (sum)
- `active_user_count` (count)
- `average_session_duration` (mean)

### Calculated Attributes

Derived from other attributes through computation.

**Examples:**
- `days_since_signup` (today minus signup_date)
- `days_until_renewal` (renewal_date minus today)
- `health_score` (composite of multiple factors)

### Action-Created Attributes

Set by campaign actions when customers complete or exit.

**Example:**
```
Campaign completion action: Set completed_onboarding_campaign = true
```

## Person vs Organisation Attributes

### Person Attributes

Describe individual users:
- Identity: email, user_id, name
- Role: job_title, permissions, admin_status
- Behaviour: last_login, feature_usage, session_count
- Trig activity: campaign membership, behaviour completion

### Organisation Attributes

Describe accounts/companies:
- Identity: company_name, domain, account_id
- Commercial: arr, contract_value, plan_type
- Relationship: customer_since, renewal_date, csm_owner
- Aggregated: total_users, active_user_count
- Trig activity: lifecycle stage, campaign outcomes

### Choosing the Right Level

| Scenario | Level | Why |
|----------|-------|-----|
| "Has this user logged in?" | Person | Individual action |
| "Is this account healthy?" | Organisation | Account assessment |
| "Send email to inactive user" | Person | Individual targeting |
| "Flag accounts for CSM review" | Organisation | Account triage |

## Using Attributes in Filters

### Building Filters

1. **Select attribute:** Choose from available attributes
2. **Select operator:** equals, not equals, greater than, contains, has value
3. **Set value:** The comparison value

**Example:**
```
signup_date is after 30 days ago
AND plan_type equals "Enterprise"
AND currently_member_of_onboarding_stage equals true
```

### Filter Groups

| Within a group | AND — All conditions must be true |
| Between groups | OR — Any group can be true |

### Common Filter Patterns

**New customers:**
```
signup_date is after 14 days ago
```

**High-value accounts:**
```
arr is greater than 50000
```

**Stuck in onboarding:**
```
currently_member_of_onboarding_stage equals true
AND days_in_stage is greater than 30
```

**Completed campaign but not next step:**
```
last_completion_of_campaign_1 has any value
AND last_entry_to_campaign_2 has no value
```

## Attributes vs Events

<Warning>
Understanding this difference is critical for building effective campaigns.
</Warning>

### Attributes

- **Nature:** Static values on a record
- **Evaluation:** Historical (checked against existing values)
- **Persistence:** Remain on record until changed

### Events

- **Nature:** Point-in-time occurrences
- **Evaluation:** Forward-only (only new events trigger)
- **Persistence:** Stream of discrete actions

### Critical Distinction

**Attributes are evaluated historically:** When you create a campaign with audience `signup_date after 30 days ago`, Trig checks existing values and immediately includes matching customers.

**Events are evaluated forward-only:** When you create completion criteria `invoice_created at least 1 time`, Trig only counts NEW events from when the campaign goes live—not historical events.

### Implication for Campaign Design

If you want to exclude customers who have already done something:
- **Use an attribute** (e.g., `first_invoice_date has no value`)
- **Don't rely on event counts** for historical behaviour

## Trig Activity Attributes Deep Dive

### The Four Core Attributes

For every Trig object, you get:

| Attribute | Meaning | Use Case |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| `currently_member_of_[X]` | Currently in this object | Exclude from other campaigns |
| `last_entry_to_[X]` | When they entered | Time-based targeting |
| `last_exit_from_[X]` | When they failed | Target failed customers |
| `last_completion_of_[X]` | When they succeeded | Target successful customers |

### Using for Campaign Chaining

**Campaign 1: Initial Nudge**
- On completion: Customer has `last_completion_of_initial_nudge`

**Campaign 2: Follow-Up for Completers**
- Audience: `last_completion_of_initial_nudge` has any value

**Campaign 3: Rescue for Non-Completers**
- Audience: `last_exit_from_initial_nudge` has any value

### Timing-Based Targeting

```
last_entry_to_onboarding_campaign is after 5 days ago
AND last_entry_to_onboarding_campaign is before 3 days ago
AND last_completion_of_onboarding_campaign has no value
```

This targets customers who entered 3-5 days ago but haven't completed—perfect for reminders.

### Persistence is Powerful

These attributes never disappear. Years later, you can still query:
- "Show me everyone who completed Campaign X in Q3 2024"
- "How many customers who failed Behaviour Y eventually churned?"

## Viewing Attributes

### Settings > Attributes

Navigate to **Settings > Audience > Attributes** to see all available:
- People Attributes
- Organisation Attributes
- Lifecycle Result Attributes
- Objective Result Attributes

### On Individual Records

Click any person or organisation to see their specific values, grouped by source:
- CRM Attributes
- Product Attributes
- Trig Activity Attributes

## Attribute Data Types

| Type | Operators | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **String** | equals, contains, starts with | `company_name contains "Tech"` |
| **Number** | equals, greater than, less than | `arr is greater than 50000` |
| **Boolean** | equals, not equals | `is_paying equals true` |
| **Date** | before, after, between | `signup_date is after 30 days ago` |
| **Array** | contains, does not contain | `tags contains "Enterprise"` |

## Common Attribute Patterns

### Commercial Attributes

```
arr (Annual Recurring Revenue)
mrr (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
contract_value
plan_type
subscription_status
renewal_date
```

### Engagement Attributes

```
last_login
login_count
session_duration
feature_usage_count
dau (Daily Active Users)
```

### Lifecycle Attributes

```
signup_date
activation_date
first_value_moment
onboarding_complete
days_as_customer
```

### Trig-Generated Attributes

```
currently_member_of_[stage/campaign/behaviour]
last_entry_to_[stage/campaign/behaviour]
last_completion_of_[stage/campaign/behaviour]
days_in_[stage]
objectives_completed_count
```

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

| Good | Bad |
|------|-----|
| `first_invoice_created_date` | `fic_dt` |
| `completed_onboarding_campaign` | `flag_1` |

### Keep Source of Truth Clear

- Don't duplicate CRM fields manually
- Use Trig-generated attributes for Trig activity
- Create dedicated fields for write-back

### Use Trig Attributes Liberally

The auto-generated attributes are extremely valuable:
- Use for progressive campaign targeting
- Build exclusion logic
- Analyse intervention outcomes

### Test Your Filters

Before launching campaigns:
- Build the filter in Audience view
- Check the resulting count
- Spot-check individual records

## Troubleshooting

### "Attribute has no value"

- Is data flowing from the source system?
- Is the attribute mapped in the integration?
- Has the customer record been synced recently?

### "Filter returns unexpected results"

- Are you using person vs org attributes correctly?
- Is the operator correct (equals vs contains)?
- Are date comparisons using the right direction?

### "Trig activity attributes not appearing"

- Has the campaign/stage/behaviour been set live?
- Has anyone entered the object yet?
- Attributes only appear after first use

## Summary

Attributes are the foundation of everything in Trig:

1. **Three sources** — Ingested (external systems), Trig-generated (platform activity), action-created (campaign outcomes)
2. **Two levels** — Person (individual users) and Organisation (accounts)
3. **Attributes = historical, Events = forward** — Critical for campaign design
4. **Trig activity attributes are powerful** — Entry/exit/completion tracking enables progressive campaigns
5. **Roll-ups aggregate up** — Person data flows to organisation level
6. **Persist forever** — Historical record enables long-term analysis

Master attributes and you master Trig.
