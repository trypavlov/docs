People and Organisations are the foundational data objects in Trig. Everything else—lifecycle stages, behaviours, cohorts, campaigns—operates on these two entity types.

## Overview

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="People" icon="user">
    Individual end users who use your product. They log in, take actions, and derive value from what you've built.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Organisations" icon="building">
    Account-level entities—the companies, teams, or commercial units that contain People. In B2B, this is typically the customer who pays you.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The relationship is hierarchical: **People belong to Organisations**. This mirrors how B2B SaaS works—you sell to companies, but individuals within those companies use your product.

## Why This Structure Matters

Trig is built for B2B SaaS, where the fundamental commercial relationship is with an organisation, not an individual:

| Concept | Organisation Level | Person Level |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Churn** | When an org leaves, that's lost revenue | Individual churn is largely outside your control (people change jobs) |
| **Value** | Adoption across the organisation defines success | One power user doesn't make an account successful |
| **Decisions** | Renewals and expansions happen with the account | Individuals influence but rarely decide alone |
| **Lifecycle** | Onboarding, adoption, renewal are org journeys | People progress within the org context |

## People

### What People Represent

People are the individual humans who use your product:

- **Identity:** Email address, user ID, name
- **Role/permissions:** Admin, user, viewer
- **Activity:** Events from product usage
- **Attributes:** Properties from CRM and product data

### People Attributes

Attributes on People come from multiple sources:

**From CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce):**
- Contact record fields
- Lead status, lifecycle stage
- Owner information

**From product data:**
- User role/permissions
- Sign-up date, last login
- Feature flags, plan information

**Generated by Trig:**
- Campaign membership and completion
- Behaviour entry and completion
- Calculated metrics

### People as Campaign Targets

When you create a campaign targeting People, the intervention goes to that specific person. Use individual-level campaigns when:

- The action requires a specific person to do something
- You're targeting based on individual behaviour
- The communication should feel personal to that user's situation

```
Campaign: Complete Profile Setup
Target: People
Audience: Users who signed up > 3 days ago, profile_complete = false
Message: "Hi Sarah, complete your profile to unlock collaboration features..."
```

## Organisations

### What Organisations Represent

Organisations are the account-level entities—typically the companies or teams that are your customers:

- **Commercial relationship:** Who pays you, contract value, renewal date
- **Unit of churn:** When an org leaves, that's lost revenue
- **Container for users:** People belong to organisations
- **Target for lifecycle tracking:** Onboarding, adoption, expansion happen at org level

### Organisation Attributes

**From CRM:**
- Account/Company record fields
- ARR, contract value, plan tier
- Industry, company size, segment
- Account owner, CSM assignment

**From product data:**
- Team/workspace information
- Aggregate usage metrics
- Feature adoption flags

**Rolled up from People:**
- Total users, active users
- Aggregate event counts
- Sum/average of individual metrics

**Generated by Trig:**
- Lifecycle stage membership
- Campaign history
- Health scores, risk flags

### Roll-Ups: Aggregating People Data

Trig can roll up individual-level data to the organisation level:

| Roll-Up Type | Example |
|--------------|---------|
| **Sum** | Total events across all users |
| **Count** | Number of users who did X |
| **Average** | Mean value across users |
| **Max/Min** | Highest or lowest individual value |

```
Organisation: Acme Corp
├── users_count: 47
├── active_users_last_30d: 32
├── total_invoices_created: 1,247
├── avg_sessions_per_user: 4.2
└── power_users_count: 5
```

### Organisations as Campaign Targets

When you create a campaign targeting Organisations, the intervention can go to:
- The account owner (from CRM)
- All contacts at the organisation
- A specific role at the organisation

```
Campaign: Integration Setup
Target: Organisation
Audience: Orgs in Onboarding stage > 14 days, integrations_connected = 0
Message to Account Owner: "Hi, your team at Acme Corp is ready for the next step..."
```

### Lifecycle Stages and Organisations

Lifecycle stages operate at the Organisation level. Your customer journey is an account journey:

```
Organisation: Acme Corp
├── Current Stage: Adoption
├── Stage Entry: November 15, 2025
├── Objectives:
│   ├── ✓ First project created (Day 2)
│   ├── ✓ Team members invited (Day 5)
│   ├── △ Integration connected (pending)
│   └── ✗ Report generated (not started)
```

Even though individuals complete objectives (Sarah created the first project), tracking happens at the org level (Acme Corp completed "First project created").

## How People Connect to Organisations

Every Person in Trig should be associated with an Organisation:

```
Organisation: Acme Corp (ID: acme-123)
├── Person: sarah@acme.com (Admin)
├── Person: john@acme.com (User)
├── Person: lisa@acme.com (User)
└── Person: mike@acme.com (Viewer)
```

The identifier that links them varies:
- **CRM-based:** HubSpot Company ID, Salesforce Account ID
- **Product-based:** Team ID, Workspace ID, Tenant ID

## Data Sources

### CRM Integration

The primary source for Organisation and People data:

| CRM | Organisations | People |
|-----|--------------|--------|
| **HubSpot** | Companies | Contacts |
| **Salesforce** | Accounts | Contacts |

CRM integration provides commercial data (ARR, contract dates), relationship data (account owner), and firmographic data (industry, size).

### Product Data Integration

Product data typically comes from:
- **Data warehouses:** Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift
- **CDPs and analytics:** Segment, Mixpanel, Amplitude, Pendo
- **Direct API:** Custom integrations, webhooks

Product data provides usage events, user properties, feature adoption signals, and engagement metrics.

### Joining Data Sources

Trig needs to join CRM data with product data using a common identifier:
- Email address matching
- External ID synced between systems
- User ID stored in CRM

Work with your implementation team to establish the join strategy.

## Choosing the Right Target Level

| Scenario | Target | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| "Has this user logged in?" | Person | Individual action |
| "Is this account healthy?" | Organisation | Account-level assessment |
| "Send email to inactive user" | Person | Individual targeting |
| "Flag accounts for CSM review" | Organisation | Account-level triage |
| "Invite team members" | Person | Specific individual needs to act |
| "Renew contract" | Organisation | Commercial decision |

## Best Practices

### Data Quality

- **Clean identifiers:** Ensure consistent IDs across systems
- **Complete associations:** Every Person should link to an Organisation
- **Regular sync:** Keep CRM and product data flowing

### Organisation Structure

- **Mirror commercial relationships:** Your org structure should reflect how you sell and manage accounts
- **Consistent granularity:** Normalise to comparable units
- **Think about lifecycle:** Ensure orgs represent the unit whose journey you're tracking

### Campaign Targeting

- **Match target to action:** If an individual needs to act, target People. If it's an account decision, target Organisations.
- **Consider the recipient:** Org campaigns go to account owner by default
- **Use role filters:** Target specific roles when appropriate

## Summary

People and Organisations form the foundation of Trig:

1. **Organisations are accounts** — The commercial unit, the target of lifecycle tracking, the entity that churns or renews
2. **People are users** — The individuals who use your product, belong to organisations, and are often the target of interventions
3. **Data flows from CRM + product** — Trig joins commercial data with usage data
4. **Attributes accumulate** — Ingested, rolled-up, and Trig-generated attributes build rich context
5. **Target appropriately** — Choose People or Organisations based on who needs to act
