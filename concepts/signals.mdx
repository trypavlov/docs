description: "Proactive alerts when customers need attention"

Signals are Trig's proactive alerting system. They surface customers who need attention right now—identifying who is off track before problems compound.

## What Are Signals?

Rather than waiting for customers to churn or disengage, Signals detect early warning patterns and prompt timely intervention.

<Note>
**Core concept:** Signals are point-in-time indicators that a specific action is needed across your customer base.
</Note>

Think of Signals as a heat map showing where attention is needed most. They answer: "Of all my customers, who should I focus on today, and why?"

## Why Signals Matter

### The Problem Signals Solve

Without Signals, finding customers who need help requires manual investigation:
- Export data to spreadsheets
- Calculate averages and compare
- Identify outliers
- Build target lists
- Hope you caught everyone

This is slow, error-prone, and doesn't scale.

### How Signals Change This

Signals automate the detection:
- Continuously evaluate all customers against criteria
- Surface those who are underperforming
- Quantify the revenue impact
- Enable immediate action via campaigns

Instead of "go find problems," Signals say "here are the problems—what do you want to do about them?"

### The Insight → Action Loop

```
Lifecycle Stage → Objectives defined
                        ↓
              Trig calculates averages
                        ↓
              Identifies customers below average
                        ↓
              Surfaces as Signal
                        ↓
              User creates Campaign from Signal
                        ↓
              Measures intervention impact
```

## How Signals Work

### The Foundation: Objectives and Averages

Signals build on lifecycle stages and objectives. When you configure objectives, Trig tracks:
- How many customers complete each objective
- How long it takes on average
- Which customers are still pending

This creates the baseline for "normal" behaviour.

### Detecting Atypical Customers

Signals identify customers who deviate from normal:

**Slow completers:** Customers who haven't completed an objective and have taken significantly longer than average (e.g., 2x the average completion time).

```
Objective: Connect Payment Gateway
Average completion time: 6 days
Signal threshold: 2x average (12 days)

Signal: "15 customers have been pending 'Connect Payment Gateway'
for more than 12 days (2x average). Revenue at risk: £47,000"
```

### The Flag System

Trig continuously evaluates:
1. For every member of an objective, calculate average time to completion
2. For anyone who hasn't completed and exceeds threshold, set a flag
3. Aggregate flags into Signals for display and action

### From Flags to Signals

```
Individual flags:
├── Customer A: slow on Objective 1 (flagged)
├── Customer B: slow on Objective 1 (flagged)
├── Customer C: slow on Objective 1 (flagged)
└── Customer D: slow on Objective 2 (flagged)

Signal 1: "3 customers slow on Objective 1"
Signal 2: "1 customer slow on Objective 2"
```

Each Signal represents a group with a common issue addressable with a single intervention.

## Signal Types

### Objective Slow Completers

Identifies customers taking longer than expected to complete objectives.

**How it works:**
1. Calculate average completion time for an objective
2. Identify pending customers who exceeded threshold (e.g., 2x average)
3. Surface as Signal with count and revenue at risk

**Example Signal:**
```
Signal: Slow Completers - "Create First Invoice"
Stage: Onboarding
Customers affected: 23
Revenue at risk: £127,000
Average completion: 4 days
These customers: 8+ days pending
```

**Why this matters:** Slow completers are at higher risk of:
- Failing to realise value
- Disengaging before activation
- Churning before renewal

### Future Signal Types (Planned)

- **Low completion rate:** Objectives with completion percentage below threshold
- **Declining engagement:** Customers whose activity has dropped significantly
- **Expansion indicators:** Customers showing upsell-ready behaviours
- **Churn predictors:** Patterns historically associated with churn

## Viewing Signals

### The Signals Dashboard

**Summary metrics:**
- Total customers at risk
- Total revenue at risk
- Number of active Signals

**Signal feed:**
- List of current Signals
- Count of affected customers
- Revenue impact
- Related objective/stage

### Navigation: Quantity → Clarity → Activity

1. **Quantity:** How many Signals? Where's the biggest problem?
2. **Clarity:** Click into a Signal to see exactly which customers and why
3. **Activity:** Create a campaign directly from the Signal

### Stage-Level View

Within a lifecycle stage:
- Objectives and completion status
- Signals associated with each objective
- Quick stats: how many at risk, revenue impact

### Objective-Level View

Drilling into an objective:
- All members in this objective
- Toggle to view only flagged customers
- Create campaign targeting Signal audience

## Acting on Signals

### Creating Campaigns from Signals

From any Signal, you can:

<Steps>
  <Step title="View affected audience">
    See exactly which customers are flagged
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a campaign">
    Launch with audience pre-populated from Signal
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define intervention">
    Configure messages for the specific issue
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Campaign Strategy for Signals

**Message relevance:** These customers are stuck on a specific objective. Address that blocker.

**Timing:** They're already slow. Act quickly once the Signal surfaces.

**Follow-up:** If the first intervention doesn't work, the Signal continues showing them.

### Iterative Intervention

Once you've created a campaign from a Signal:
- Customers in the campaign are being addressed
- New customers falling behind appear in future Signal refreshes
- Add new customers to existing campaign or create new ones

## Configuring for Signals

### Prerequisites

To generate Signals:

1. **Lifecycle stages configured** with entry/exit criteria
2. **Objectives within stages** with completion criteria
3. **Customers in stages** actively progressing
4. **Sufficient data** for meaningful averages

### Objective Design for Effective Signals

Design objectives that:
- **Represent meaningful milestones** (not trivial clicks)
- **Have clear completion criteria**
- **Are achievable in reasonable time**
- **Cover the critical path to value**

### Threshold Considerations

| Threshold | Sensitivity | Trade-off |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **1.5x average** | High | Earlier alerts, more noise |
| **2x average** | Moderate | Balanced detection |
| **3x average** | Low | Fewer alerts, later detection |

## Signal Workflow Example

### Scenario: Onboarding Slow Completers

**Setup:**
- Stage: Onboarding (Days 1-30)
- Objective: "Complete Profile Setup"
- Average completion: 3 days
- Threshold: 2x (6 days)

**Signal appears:**
```
Slow Completers - Complete Profile Setup
12 customers | £34,000 revenue at risk
```

**Investigation:**
- 8 are self-serve plan
- 4 are enterprise
- Mix of industries

**Action:**
Create campaign targeting these 12:
- Goal: profile_complete = true
- Entry: "Here's why your profile matters and how to do it in 2 minutes..."
- Auto-exit: 7 days

**Outcome:**
- 8 complete (success)
- 4 exit without completing (need different approach)
- Signal updates with new slow completers

## Signals vs Other Objects

| Object | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Behaviours** | Track when customers achieve milestones (historical) |
| **Signals** | Alert when customers are failing to achieve milestones (ongoing) |
| **Cohorts** | Static/dynamic audience segments |
| **Campaigns** | Intervention mechanisms |

Signals detect problems. Campaigns address them.

## Best Practices

### Start with Core Objectives

Don't Signal everything. Focus on:
- Objectives that predict success/failure
- Early lifecycle milestones
- High-value customer segments

### Act Quickly on Signals

Signals surface customers already behind. Delay compounds the problem:
1. Review same day
2. Create campaign if warranted
3. Don't wait for perfect message

### Review Signal Patterns

If the same Signal keeps appearing:
- Is the objective realistic?
- Is there a product friction point?
- Do customers need more support?

Recurring Signals may indicate systemic issues.

### Don't Over-Intervene

- Customers shouldn't receive too many automated messages
- Some slowness may be acceptable (enterprise moves slower)
- Use exclusions to prevent campaign overlap

### Measure Campaign Impact

Track whether Signal-driven campaigns improve outcomes:
- Do recipients complete faster than non-recipients?
- Does intervention reduce Signal population over time?
- What message content works best?

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How often do Signals refresh?">
    Continuously as customer data updates. New slow completers appear as they cross the threshold.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I customize the threshold?">
    Thresholds are configured by Trig. Future versions may expose configuration in the UI.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I don't have enough data for averages?">
    You need sufficient completions for meaningful averages. Generally 10+ completions for stability.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can Signals detect positive patterns?">
    v0.1 focuses on risk detection. Positive signals (expansion opportunities) are planned.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How is revenue calculated?">
    Summed from ARR/contract value of affected customers (from CRM data).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens when customers complete the objective?">
    They're removed from the Signal. Campaign tracks this as completion.
  </Accordion>

## Summary

Signals transform Trig from observation to action:

1. **Built on objectives** — Require lifecycle stages and objectives as foundation
2. **Automated detection** — Continuously evaluate all customers against thresholds
3. **Quantified impact** — Revenue at risk makes prioritisation clear
4. **Direct to action** — Create campaigns directly from Signals
5. **Iterative** — New customers surfaced as they fall behind

Signals show you which customers need help before it's too late.
